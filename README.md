#The Challenge

All Inbox, LLC does lots of formatting, templating, and automation of digital media, content, and marketing.  One of those mediums is email. All Inbox sends lots of emails. Millions of them. We need to reformat this email inbox file (called an mbox).  Can you help us?


You will be given an email mbox file filled with single-part email messages with a content type of text/plain. Your goal is to take this mbox file with your script and generate another mbox file with all the email messages. The new mbox file will have the emails in the same order, but with the lines of each individual message body printed in reverse order.


The email headers and properly delimited email signatures remain unchanged.

You are given a sample input and output, but we will judge your code on a larger set of inputs. You are encouraged to do your research to determine the official formatting for an “mbox file” and all of the other terms used here.


Upon registration via this landing page, you will receive an email that includes the Challenge Zip file. There are three files inside the zip file.  All are plain text formatted. Mbox_example (think of this as the “before”), mbox_example_reversed (the “after”), and mbox_full (the one you should run your code against).
