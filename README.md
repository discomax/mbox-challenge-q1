# Mbox Challenge 

This script reads an email mbox file filled with singlepart
and multipart/mixed email messages with a content  type of 
text/plain. It takes the mbox file and genrates anoutner mbox
file with all the mbox files in the same order, but with the
lines of each individual message bady printed in reverse order.

This tool accepts text (.txt) files as well as mbox (.full) files. 

This script requires `mailbox` be installed within the  Python
environment you are running the script in.

# The Challenge

All Inbox, LLC does lots of formatting, templating, and automation of digital media, content, and marketing.  One of those mediums is email. All Inbox sends lots of emails. Millions of them. We need to reformat this email inbox file (called an mbox).  Can you help us?

You will be given an email mbox file filled with single-part email messages with a content type of text/plain. Your goal is to take this mbox file with your script and generate another mbox file with all the email messages. The new mbox file will have the emails in the same order, but with the lines of each individual message body printed in reverse order.

The email headers and properly delimited email signatures remain unchanged.

You are given a sample input and output, but we will judge your code on a larger set of inputs. You are encouraged to do your research to determine the official formatting for an “mbox file” and all of the other terms used here.

Upon registration via this landing page, you will receive an email that includes the Challenge Zip file. There are three files inside the zip file.  All are plain text formatted. Mbox_example (think of this as the “before”), mbox_example_reversed (the “after”), and mbox_full (the one you should run your code against).

# The Process 

All Inbox, LLC employees will evaluate the submissions and come to a consensus on a winner. You will be evaluated upon completion of the requirements of the challenge, code cleanliness, and formatting. 

### Some guidelines...

Your code should be clean and readable.  Good code is clean code.

Comments in your code are more than welcome.  Often times a properly worded variable suffices as a comment.  All Inbox is not interested in confusing, obfuscated spaghetti code. We read and write code every day, and our code base is huge. We evaluate each other’s code every single day.

You MUST submit this as a git repository.  Learning to use git is an important skill. All Inbox staff use git every single day.  It is essential for us to collaborate and merge code. Google drive links, zip files, or Drop Boxes are not acceptable for submission.

Commit early, commit often.  We want to see your code as you progress through the project.

Your GitHub/GitLab repository should have a readme file and explain what each file is and how to use them.
